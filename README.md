# JS-Challenge
In this project, I created a webpage that accepts a date input, searches a database of ufo sightings, and returns a filtered list of ufo sightings that occured on that date.
Index.html runs the webpage. App.js accepts the filter date, filters the data, and builds the table on the page. Data.js stores the data.
